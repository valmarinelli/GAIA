This is the Solar SpectroRadiometer (SRS) python command interface - SRSpci

Version: 0.2
Date: 2018-03-19
- Initial avaspecSRS module version, with some more function imported from the
  C++ library with respect to the initial AvaSpec Linux example: AVS_Deactivate,
  AVS_Done

Version: 0.5
Date: 2018-03-29
- Added and corrected some more function: AVS_GetAnalogIn,
  AVS_GetLambda, AVS_SetDigOut. All of them should be OK, only the last is yet
  to be tested (need to connect the shutter)
- Created the OperateSRS module
- Set the global variable NPIXEL in avaspecSRS, as we are going to use only one
  model of spectrometer/detector

Version: 0.7.5
Date: 2018-04-06
- Added WriteHeader, modified WriteData output format
- Modified the CFG module to accommodate the single-instrument approach

Version: 0.8
Date: 2018-04-09
- Small cleanings on comments
- When there's no device attached, Initialization now gives empty output
- Modified WriteHeader and WriteData output format

Version: 0.9
Date: 2018-04-16
- Added, removed or modified comments on several functions
- Modified sunrad_spa and sunPosition input variables (Site,Height)
- Corrected ERRORS in sunPosition and sunrad_spa, leading to wrong SZAs.
  **However, sunrad_spa still gives Azimuth values that can be 180 deg. away**
- Modified WriteHeader and WriteData in more pythonic fashion
- Removed GetData, moved into new, more complex function: GetMeasure

Version: 0.9.5
Date: 2018-05-10
- ozone_OD: implemented Wavelgt interpolation, corrected and simplified code
- created no2_OD for NO2 optical depth calculation
- created wv_MTau for water vapour effective optical depth calculation (m*Tau)
- Created the __init__ module containing SRSpci modules list, created CHANGELOG
- Exported Skyrad- and Sunrad-related functions to the SkyradTools module

Version: 0.9.6
Date: 2018-05-11
- avaspec_SRS: changed the libavs path, from user-owned to system path. In
  case it is needed, it has to be modified the LIBAVS_PATH variable accordingly.
